This is a basic React web app that fetches data from the given API and displays it in a list view. Users can search for employees by their first name using the search box. I have made use of React hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to manage state and fetch the data from the API. I have fetch the data when the component mounts using the useEffect hook. The fetched data is stored in the users state variable. I also have a searchTerm state variable to store the value entered in the search box.
